Prerequisites
=============

  - GNU g++ >= 4.5.0  http://gcc.gnu.org/
  - libcutl           http://www.codesynthesis.com/projects/libcutl/

Building on UNIX
================

The following build instructions are for the Linux/UNIX/Mac OS X
operating systems.

The standard autotools-based build system is used on these platforms. 
After unpacking the source code archive, change to the odb package
directory (referred to as odb/ from now on) and run the configure
script:

./configure

To see the available configuration options run configure with --help:

./configure --help

The configure script expects the libcutl headers and libraries to be
installed in a directory where the C++ compiler and linker will search
for them by default (normally /usr and /usr/local). If libcutl is
installed in another directory, you can use the CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS
configure variables to specify its location, for example:

./configure CPPFLAGS=-I/opt/libcutl/include LDFLAGS=-L/opt/libcutl/lib

If libcutl is not installed and you would like to use its build
directory instead, you can use the --with-libcutl configure option
to specify its location, for example:

./configure --with-libcutl=/tmp/libcutl

As another example, the following configure command uses the specified
GNU g++ compiler and compiles with optimization and without the debug
information:

./configure CXX=g++-4.5 CXXFLAGS=-O3

Once configuration is complete, run make to build odb:

make

Once the build completes successfully, you can install odb using the install
target (you may need to do this step as root depending on the installation
directory):

make install


Building on Windows
===================

Building odb on Windows involves a custom build procedure. Consider 
using the pre-compiled binary distribution of odb for Windows or write
